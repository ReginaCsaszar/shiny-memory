Your taks will be to simulate a race. You will need to create 10 cars, 10 trucks, 10 motorcycles, and race them for 50 hours. After simulating the race print the results.

As a guideline here are the classes you will need to create and some of their functions/properties. Note that this is just a skeleton, feel free to add more methods/variables. But you must implement the ones described here!

Main
 static isRaining //30% chance of rain every hour
 createVehicles() // creates 10 cars, 10 trucks and 10 motorcycles
 simulateRace() // simulates the race by calling moveForAnHour() on every vehicle 50 times and setting whether its raining.
 printRaceResults() // prints each vehicle's name, distance traveled ant type.

Car
 // Since cars are so fast there is a 30% chance that they can go only with 70km/h speed.
 static setSpeedLimit(int limit) // Call this from the Main class!
 normalSpeed // the normal speed of the car. Set to a random number in the constructor between 80-110km/h.
 name // Make a list from the words here: http://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/car-names.php and pick 2 randomly for each instance.
 distanceTraveled // holds the current distance traveled.
 moveForAnHour() // The vehicle travels for an hour. It increases the distance traveled. Call this from the main class only!

Motorcycle // speed is 100km/h. If rains, travels with 5-50km/h slower (randomly).
 static nameNumber // The number of the instance created. Used for its name.
 name // Are called "Motorcycle 1", "Motorcycle 2", "Motorcycle 3",... Unique.
 distanceTraveled
 moveForAnHour()

Truck // speed: 100km/h. 5% chance of breaking down for 2 hours.
 // Truck drivers are boring. They call all their trucks a random number between 0 and 1000.
 breakdownTurnsLeft // holds how long its still broken down.
 distanceTraveled
 moveForAnHour()

Hints

Use the built in Random class to generate random numbers.
